- [x] SPEC.md — all phases marked complete
- [x] start.bat — local server script added for easy browser access

### Post-Phase Fixes & Improvements
- [x] workflow/index.js — `_validateProductReadiness` no longer blocks REVISION_REQUESTED_BY_SALES → PENDING_ADMIN
- [x] manufacturer/product-form.js — per-variant cost fields with shared/per-variant toggle
- [x] admin/product-detail.js — transfer price preview uses `body.querySelector()` (not `document.getElementById()`)
- [x] sales/product-detail.js — `descDiv.innerHTML` renders rich HTML; `white-space:pre-wrap` removed
- [x] admin/product-queue.js — `_fetchProducts` defined, loads PENDING_ADMIN for queue / all products for all-mode
- [x] manufacturer/dashboard.js + admin/product-queue.js — async blob thumbnails per row; `esc()` XSS protection
- [x] manufacturer/product-view.js — REVISION_REQUESTED_BY_SALES in EDITABLE_STATUSES; Sales revision alert; "Resubmit to Admin" button
- [x] manufacturer/dashboard.js — onboarding empty state for first-time users; N+1 thumbnail replaced with queryByIndex
- [x] modules/auth/index.js — MANUFACTURER_TRANSITIONS: `REVISION_REQUESTED_BY_SALES:PENDING_ADMIN` added; dead ADMIN_TRANSITIONS entry removed
- [x] modules/workflow/index.js — REVISION_REQUESTED_BY_SALES routes to `['PENDING_ADMIN', 'ARCHIVED']`
- [x] test/e2e.test.js — testStep6 covers full Sales revision loop through PENDING_ADMIN
- [x] Fixed XSS vulnerability in product description rendering (Admin/Sales panels) — commit 0ef6baf
- [x] Fixed parent cost multiplier logic bug in per-variant mode — commit 0ef6baf
- [x] Fixed version snapshot desynchronization during workflow transitions — commit 0ef6baf
- [x] Fixed ObjectURL memory leak on media uploads — commit 0ef6baf
- [x] Fixed DB schema upgrade logic to allow index additions on existing stores — commit 8e3d1fa

### Audit Batch Fixes (post-audit session)
- [x] BUG-001 — XSS vulnerability resolved in Admin, Sales, and Manufacturer panels.
- [x] BUG-002 — Per-variant cost unit calculation fixed.
- [x] BUG-003 — Workflow snapshot data sync resolved.
- [x] BUG-004 — ObjectURL memory leak on media upload resolved.
- [x] BUG-005 — DB schema upgrade logic for existing stores fixed.
- [x] test/e2e.test.js — added validation steps for cost logic and snapshot sync.
- [x] BUG-001 — sales/product-detail.js: `_collectPricing` now uses scoped `pricingContent.querySelector()` (was `document.getElementById()`)
- [x] BUG-002 — sales/product-detail.js: campaign pre-selection and save now use `activeCampaignId` (was `campaignId`)
- [x] BUG-003 — sales/product-detail.js: `savePricing()` guard changed to `price == null || price < 0`; inline validation via `SALES_PRICING_SCHEMA`
- [x] BUG-004 — admin/product-queue.js: N+1 thumbnail replaced with parallel `queryByIndex` per product
- [x] BUG-005 — auth/index.js: `canDo` and `canEdit` accept `{ silent: true }` option; violation not logged for UI visibility checks
- [x] BUG-006 — logger.js + auth/index.js: `logViolation` now accepts `userId` param; all callers pass `_currentUser?.userId`
- [x] BUG-007 — manufacturer/product-form.js: `_saving` flag with try/finally prevents double-save race; save button also guards
- [x] validator.js: `costMaterial` changed from `gt:0` to `min:0` (allow free items); `adminMarginPct` max reduced to 500; added `SALES_PRICING_SCHEMA`
- [x] manufacturer/product-form.js: negative cost warning label in `_tabCosts()`; compareAtPrice < sellingPrice warning in sales pricing form
- [x] campaign-form.js: non-blocking >100% discount warning with console.warn
- [x] super-admin/index.js: added Audit Log nav item (reuses admin/audit-log.js)
- [x] sales/index.js + product-queue.js: added All Products view (mode: 'all', PENDING_SALES + READY_FOR_ECOMMERCE)
- [x] test/e2e.test.js: added steps 10–13 (rejection path, negative costs, campaign edge cases, double-save guard)

### Phase 6 — Per-Variant Financial Architecture (COMPLETE)
- [x] src/core/validator.js — VARIANT_SCHEMA now includes optional costMaterial/costLabor/costPackaging with min:0 rules
- [x] src/panels/manufacturer/product-form.js — shared-mode toggle propagates global draft costs to all variants on revert
- [x] src/panels/admin/product-detail.js — variant table now has inline-editable Material/Labor/Packaging columns; per-variant cost changes patch variant record only (never product costBase)
- [x] src/core/engine.js — new `calculateVariantTransferPrice(variant, productAdminConfig)` pure function
- [x] src/panels/admin/product-detail.js — "Save Costs" now iterates all variants, computes per-variant transferPrice via engine, persists to variants store and updates live Transfer Price cell
- [x] src/panels/sales/product-detail.js — variant pricing table gains Effective Price read-only column with live recalculation on variant selling price or campaign change; fallback to product.sellingPrice
- [x] src/modules/workflow/index.js — READY_FOR_ECOMMERCE readiness check extended: with variants, passes if any variant OR product has sellingPrice > 0; without variants, requires product.sellingPrice > 0
- [x] src/app.js — boot-time migration hydrates missing variant costs from parent product and calculates transferPrice; idempotency guarded by `variant_migration_complete` settings flag

## Next Task — Resume Here
Nothing remaining. All phases complete, all audit-identified bugs resolved, all critical test gaps filled.

## Known Limitations (not bugs — Phase 6 scope or by design)
- compareAtPrice warning is informational only (does not block save); pre-existing data with compareAtPrice < sellingPrice is not retroactively flagged
- Audit log entries created before BUG-006 fix will have `userId: null` (pre-fix data, cannot be backfilled without a migration)
- No real authentication — login screen accepts any credentials; user identity is stored in IndexedDB settings
- No server-side persistence — all data is in browser IndexedDB, lost on clear/different browser
- No e-commerce export — READY_FOR_ECOMMERCE status is terminal; no Shopify/WooCommerce push yet
- No image compression — blobs stored raw; large images may stress IndexedDB on some browsers
- No pagination — all product queries load full result sets into memory
- No stock update UI — stock counts visible in Admin Stock view but only editable via direct DB writes
- No notification system — revision requests are visible only when user actively opens the panel

## Key Implementation Notes
- All workflow transitions: `import { transition } from '../../modules/workflow/index.js'`
- All validation: `import { validate, PRODUCT_SCHEMA, ... } from '../../core/validator.js'`
- Product queries: `DB.queryByIndex('products', 'status', 'PENDING_ADMIN')` — status is indexed
- Notes are REQUIRED for REVISION_REQUESTED_* and REJECTED transitions (workflow enforces this)
- Admin cost layer save: use `DB.patch('products', id, { adminTaxPct, adminMarginPct, ... })` before calling transition
- Sales selling price save: use `DB.patch('products', id, { sellingPrice, compareAtPrice })` before calling transition
- Super Admin override: call `transition()` with SUPER_ADMIN user — workflow bypasses ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS for that role
- Image blobs: store in mediaBlobs store with blobId; MediaObject on product holds metadata only
- campaign effectivePrice: never stored, always computed at render time via `getEffectivePrice(product, campaign)` from engine.js
- **Local Dev:** Run `start.bat` to start a Python server and open the app in your browser.

## Known Limitations (Phase 6 scope)
- No real authentication — login screen accepts any credentials; user identity is stored in IndexedDB settings
- No server-side persistence — all data is in browser IndexedDB, lost on clear/different browser
- No e-commerce export — READY_FOR_ECOMMERCE status is terminal; no Shopify/WooCommerce push yet
- No image compression — blobs stored raw; large images may stress IndexedDB on some browsers
- No pagination — all product queries load full result sets into memory
- No stock update UI — stock counts visible in Admin Stock view but only editable via direct DB writes
- No notification system — revision requests are visible only when user actively opens the panel

## What Phase 6 (E-Commerce Integration) Will Need
- Export adapter: read READY_FOR_ECOMMERCE products + campaigns, format for target platform (Shopify/WooCommerce)
- Webhook or polling to sync stock levels back from the platform into IndexedDB
- A new `PUBLISHED` status after READY_FOR_ECOMMERCE (optional — depends on platform integration)
- Real auth: JWT or session token, server-side user store
- Optionally: backend API replacing IndexedDB for multi-device / multi-user shared state
